# Buffalo Coders: Dockerfiles

Some common
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
configuration files used in
[Buffalo Coders](http://www.buffalo-coders.org)
projects.

## Rationale

Enable
[DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) principles, even in Docker.

## Prerequisites

Please make sure you have
[GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
installed.

## Building

  * Issue `make` command at the top level, or at any
    internal directory.

## TODOs

I need to explore how to get these built and deployed to the
official Docker Hub.
